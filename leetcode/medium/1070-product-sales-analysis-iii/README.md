| sale_id     | int   |
| product_id  | int   |
| year        | int   |
| quantity    | int   |
| price       | int   |

(sale_id, year) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
Each row records a sale of a product in a given year.
A product may have multiple sales entries in the same year.
Note that the per-unit price.

```

Write a solution to find all sales that occurred in the  **first year**  each product was sold.

- For each product_id, identify the earliest year it appears in the Sales table.
- Return all sales entries for that product in that year.

Return a table with the following columns:  **product_id**, **first_year**,  **quantity,** and **price**.
Return the result in any order.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: 
Sales table:
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
| sale_id | product_id | year | quantity | price |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+ 
| 1       | 100        | 2008 | 10       | 5000  |
| 2       | 100        | 2009 | 12       | 5000  |
| 7       | 200        | 2011 | 15       | 9000  |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+

Output: 
+------------+------------+----------+-------+
| product_id | first_year | quantity | price |
+------------+------------+----------+-------+ 
| 100        | 2008       | 10       | 5000  |
| 200        | 2011       | 15       | 9000  |
